<h3>Project 1: Sculpting With Light</h3>

<p>In this first unit we will be exploring light.  We'll learn all about circuits, switches, LEDs, various kinds of sensors, and how to use a raspberry pi to connect and control various circuits.  We'll build low resolution monitors from arrays of addressable LEDs and think about ways of deconstructing imaging devices in order to create sculptural installations.</p>

<p>Your first project can be anything that uses LEDs.  You may want to create an array of LEDs to make a low resolution sculptural installation as Jim Cambell does, or you may want to do some 'light painting' as Anthony McCall and other artists have done, or you may want to make something wearable, or you may have an entirely different idea!  It's really up to you.  The main thing is, get started ASAP!  Order some parts and experiment and see what happens!</p>

<p>Crits for the first project are 9/19 and 9/21</p>


<h3>Project 2: Mashup In Multiple Dimensions</h3>
<p>In this second unit we will explore notions of collection and the meaning of data and look at a variety of approaches to working with that material.  We will introduce sound and functional programming and time-based editing to our repertoire of tricks.  The unit will culminate in your midterm project, which should be a “mashup in multiple dimensions”, a three dimensional light and sound installation that incorporates a collection of distinct but related time-based audio-visual clips.</p>


<p>Crits for the midterm project are 10/17 and 10/19</p>





<h3>Project 3: Game On!</h3> 
<p>In this third unit we will draw our inspiration from games.  W
e will take some of the skills we have already learned, refine them a little, and make an interactive game.  How can we utilize games in the creation of art?  What lessons can art draw from games?</p>

<p>Your game project can be any kind of game you like.  It can be a video game, or a real world socially interactive game mediated by technology, or it can be a board game or a card game or a musical score or simply a happening.</p>

<p>Crits for the midterm project are 11/07 and 11/09</p>


<h3>Project 4: Group Performance! 11/21</h3>

<h3>Project 5: Final Project</h3>

<p>Crits for the final project are 12/05 and 12/07</p>
